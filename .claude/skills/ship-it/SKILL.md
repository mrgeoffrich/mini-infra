name: ship-it
description: Squash-merges the PR for an `mk` issue that's sitting in `in_review` and transitions the issue to `done`. Accepts an `mk` issue key (`MINI-NN`), a bare number (`32`, resolved against the current repo's prefix), or **no argument** (uses the current branch's open PR — same fallback shape as `address-review`). Reads `mk issue brief` to find the attached PR, pre-flights `gh pr view` to confirm the PR is mergeable, has no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review, and that the status-check rollup is green; if anything is red the skill stops and surfaces what's failing rather than forcing a merge into a broken state. Runs `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (the squash subject defaults to the PR title and the body picks up `Closes MINI-NN` from the PR description so the audit trail stays tidy), then `mk issue state MINI-NN done --user Claude` and posts a brief merge-record comment with the merge commit SHA + PR URL on the mk issue. The remote branch is deleted as part of the merge; the local worktree is left alone — the report ends with a hint to run `/finish-worktree mini-NN` next so worktree cleanup stays a deliberate separate step. Use this skill whenever the user says "ship MINI-NN", "ship it", "merge MINI-NN", "squash and merge MINI-NN", "land the PR for MINI-NN", "merge and close MINI-NN", "ship the PR", or any equivalent ask to land a reviewed PR and close out its mk ticket. Do **not** trigger when the issue is in `in_progress` (work isn't done yet — use `address-review` or push more commits), `done` (already shipped), or `backlog`/`todo` (no PR to merge); in those cases the skill stops and asks rather than guessing. Do **not** trigger for non-mk PRs — use `gh pr merge` directly for those.

# Ship It

This skill takes a reviewed PR over the finish line: squash-merge on GitHub, then transition the `mk` issue from `in_review` to `done` with a merge-record comment. It's the bookend to `execute-next-task` (which leaves the issue in `in_review` once the PR is open) and the inverse of `address-review` (which pulls the issue back to `in_progress` to apply review feedback).

The hard guarantee: **the merge and the mk transition happen together, or neither happens**. Drift between GitHub and `mk` is the whole reason this skill exists — humans forget to flip the state after merging, and then the board lies about what's done.

The remote branch is **deleted** as part of `gh pr merge --delete-branch`. After a squash-merge the branch is dead weight; cleaning it up in the same step keeps `gh pr list` honest. The local worktree is left alone — `/finish-worktree mini-NN` is a separate concern with its own defensive checks (uncommitted work, unpushed commits), and chaining it here would let "ship the PR" silently nuke a directory the user might still be using.

## Arguments

The skill accepts one optional argument:

- **`<issue-key | number | nothing>`** — `MINI-32`, a bare `32` (resolved against the current repo's prefix), or no argument at all.

Resolution rules, in order:

1. **Explicit `MINI-NN`** → use it directly.
2. **Bare number** → prefix with the current repo's `mk` prefix (run `mk repo show -o json` once and take `.prefix`).
3. **No argument** → look at the current branch. If it matches `claude/mini-NN`, derive `MINI-NN` from it. Otherwise stop and ask — the skill never auto-picks "the most recent in_review issue" because shipping the wrong PR is unrecoverable.

Accept surrounding text containing the pattern: `ship MINI-32 please` → `MINI-32`.

---

## Phase 1 — Load the issue and find the PR

Run `mk issue brief` once and reuse the result throughout the skill. Single read; everything you need (issue, state, attached PRs) is in there.

```bash
mk issue brief MINI-NN > /tmp/brief-MINI-NN.json
```

From the brief, pull:

- `.issue.state` — must be `in_review` (Phase 2 enforces this).
- `.issue.title` — used in the report.
- `.pull_requests[]` — list of attached PR URLs.

**No PR attached?** Fall back to `gh pr list --search "MINI-NN" --state open --json number,url,headRefName,title -L 5` to discover unattached PRs. If exactly one matches, use it and offer to attach it via `mk pr attach` after the merge succeeds. If zero match, stop — there's nothing to ship; ask the user whether the work is actually finished. If multiple match, list them and ask which.

**Multiple PRs attached?** Stop and ask which to merge. Don't guess based on "most recent" — sometimes an earlier PR is the canonical one and a later one is a spike.

Convert the chosen PR URL to a PR number for `gh` calls: extract the trailing `/pull/<N>` segment, or just pass the URL directly to `gh pr view <URL>` which `gh` accepts.

---

## Phase 2 — Validate state and PR readiness

Two gates: the `mk` state, and GitHub's view of the PR.

### Gate 1 — Issue state must be `in_review`

```bash
state=$(jq -r '.issue.state' /tmp/brief-MINI-NN.json)
```

- `in_review` → proceed.
- `in_progress` → stop. The work isn't reviewed yet. Surface this and suggest the user push more commits / get review first, or use `address-review` if a `/review` comment is waiting.
- `done` → stop. Already shipped. Read the recent comments and the PR's `mergedAt` to confirm; tell the user.
- `backlog` / `todo` → stop. There's nothing to ship — no PR has been opened yet.
- `cancelled` / `duplicate` → stop. The issue is closed for a reason other than completion; merging would contradict the closure.

In every non-`in_review` case, surface what's there and ask before proceeding. The skill does not silently transition through other states — that's how a `done` issue gets re-merged or a `cancelled` ticket gets accidentally shipped.

### Gate 2 — PR must be mergeable, green, and approved

```bash
gh pr view <PR-URL-or-number> --json \
  number,title,state,isDraft,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,headRefName,url \
  > /tmp/pr-MINI-NN.json
```

Check, in order:

- `.state == "OPEN"` — if `MERGED`, the merge already happened; jump to Phase 4 and just transition the mk issue. If `CLOSED` (and not merged), stop and ask — closing without merging usually means the work was abandoned.
- `.isDraft == false` — drafts aren't ready. Stop and ask whether to mark ready first.
- `.mergeable == "MERGEABLE"` — `CONFLICTING` means rebase needed; `UNKNOWN` means GitHub is still computing (retry once after a few seconds, then surface). Stop on either.
- `.reviewDecision != "CHANGES_REQUESTED"` — outstanding change requests block the merge. Stop and list which reviewers requested changes.
- `.statusCheckRollup` — every check must have `conclusion == "SUCCESS"` (or `state == "SUCCESS"` for legacy commit statuses). Pending checks (`status == "IN_PROGRESS"` or `conclusion == null`) also block — wait or stop. Failures (`FAILURE`, `TIMED_OUT`, `CANCELLED`) are hard stops; list the failing check names so the user knows what to fix.

A note on `reviewDecision == "REVIEW_REQUIRED"`: this means the repo's branch protection requires approval and none has been recorded. Don't auto-override — surface it and ask. The user may know the protection is advisory, or may want to nudge a reviewer.

If any gate fails, stop and report what's blocking. Don't pass `--admin` to `gh pr merge` to bypass branch protection unless the user explicitly asks for it — that's a "shoot yourself in the foot" flag and should never be a default.

---

## Phase 3 — Squash and merge

With both gates green, run the merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <PR-URL-or-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

Notes on the flags:

- **`--squash`** — collapses the branch into a single commit on `main`. The squash subject defaults to the PR title; the squash body defaults to the PR description. The PR description should already include `Closes MINI-NN` (every skill that opens a PR is supposed to add this), so the merge commit on `main` will carry it forward — useful for `git log` archaeology even though `mk` doesn't watch GitHub events.
- **`--delete-branch`** — deletes the remote branch. After a squash-merge the original commits aren't reachable from `main` anyway, so leaving the branch is just clutter. Local branches and worktrees are untouched — that's `finish-worktree`'s job.

`gh pr merge` is interactive by default when stdin is a TTY; with `--squash` and `--delete-branch` both supplied it runs non-interactively. If `gh` returns a non-zero exit, **stop** — don't retry blindly. Common failures:

- "Pull Request is not mergeable" → branch protection / status check changed between Phase 2 and now (race). Re-run Phase 2's `gh pr view`, surface the new state.
- "merge commit cannot be created" → conflicts. Stop; the user has to rebase.
- "API rate limit exceeded" → wait and let the user retry.

After a successful merge, capture the merge commit SHA for the mk comment in Phase 4:

```bash
merge_sha=$(gh pr view <PR-URL-or-number> --json mergeCommit -q '.mergeCommit.oid')
```

If the SHA comes back empty, fall back to whatever `gh pr merge` printed to stderr/stdout — but the `gh pr view` shape is the reliable source.

---

## Phase 4 — Transition the issue to `done` and record the merge

Two `mk` calls. Order matters: state transition first (so the board reflects reality immediately), then the comment (so the audit log records the merge alongside the state change).

```bash
mk issue state MINI-NN done --user Claude
```

Then write a brief merge-record comment to a temp file and post it. Keep it terse — the PR diff is the real record; this is just a pointer.

```bash
cat <<EOF > /tmp/merge-MINI-NN.md
Merged via squash to \`main\`.

- PR: <PR-URL>
- Merge commit: \`<merge-sha>\`
- Branch \`<headRefName>\` deleted on remote.
EOF

mk comment add MINI-NN --as Claude --user Claude --body-file /tmp/merge-MINI-NN.md
rm /tmp/merge-MINI-NN.md
```

If the PR was discovered via `gh pr list` (i.e. not previously attached to the mk issue), also attach it now so the issue's `pull_requests[]` reflects what shipped:

```bash
mk pr attach MINI-NN <PR-URL> --user Claude
```

If either `mk` call fails after the merge succeeded, **don't try to undo the merge** — that's not recoverable. Surface the failure to the user with the exact `mk` command that failed so they can re-run it manually. The merge is the source of truth; the mk state is the bookkeeping that has to catch up.

---

## Phase 5 — Report

State what shipped, link the merge, and hint at the next step:

```
✓ Shipped MINI-NN — "<issue title>"
  PR <PR-URL> squash-merged to main as <short-sha>.
  Branch <headRefName> deleted on remote.
  mk issue MINI-NN moved in_review → done.

Next: `/finish-worktree mini-NN` to tear down the local worktree + dev-env VM.
```

Mention the `/finish-worktree` hint only if a worktree actually exists (`git worktree list | grep .claude/worktrees/mini-NN`). If the work was done outside the worktree flow, drop that line — there's nothing to clean up.

---

## Hard rules

- **Never merge an issue that isn't `in_review`.** Other states mean the work isn't ready, is already done, or was cancelled. Stop and ask.
- **Never bypass branch protection.** Don't pass `--admin` to `gh pr merge` unless the user explicitly asks for it. If the protection is wrong, fix the protection.
- **Never force-merge over failing CI.** Failing checks are signal. The user can override after diagnosing, but the default must be stop-and-surface.
- **Never undo a merge to repair a mk failure.** If the GitHub merge succeeded but `mk issue state` failed, the merge stands and the user re-runs the mk command manually. Reverting a merge to "keep the systems in sync" is far more destructive than a temporary state mismatch.
- **Never auto-pick "the most recent in_review issue" when no argument is given.** Fall back to the current branch only; otherwise stop and ask. Shipping the wrong PR is unrecoverable.
- **Never auto-run `/finish-worktree`.** Suggest it in the report. The worktree may still hold uncommitted local edits the user wants; `finish-worktree`'s defensive checks exist for a reason and shouldn't be sidestepped.
- **Never produce an ExitPlanMode block.** This is an action skill, not a planning skill.
